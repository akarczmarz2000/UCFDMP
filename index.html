			<p>So.. this page was created by myself to help my players communicate with me but also get to see
				what I am up to and what I am thinking about doing. On here is lots of interesting information about
				myself and the games I am playing that will be updated on a regular bases, such info as where I feel
				my
				skill sits in each type of game; and things like what achievements I have managed to do and how you
				get them.
			</p>
			<p>With this site I really hope I can give you the content you want to see. If you feel I can do
				something different to make these videos better I'd love to hear your opinion, but I do ask one
				thing from the users of this page. I have a <b>Zero Tolerance</b> for any form of bullying or
				harrasement. I also take pride in keeping your private information private, so any and all violation
				of this will be <b>prosicuted with strongest legal action.</b></p>

	<div class="l-d-container">
		<div class="body-text">
			<p>On the About page there is lots of interesting information that tells the story of how I got to
				where I am at now. To be more specific I have tried to ask commonly asked questions, whilst doing
				this I have added a bit of my history in so those who don't know me (or those who do and want to know
				more) can have a read through and I think understand why I create YouTube and Twitch content.

	<div class="l-d-container">
		<div class="body-text">
			<p>I have two pages that relate to this. The first page is the gaming page which has a small explanation
				of the game, with some interesting facts like the publisher, how old the game is and a small.
				I have tried to make sure each one has a small synopsis of the begining story.
			</p>
			<p> Then under that I have tried to explain why I play and what I enjoy most about the game.
				This could be features, story or something else that the game offers. In the future I want to also
				put in this section who I have played this game with so if you guys like the content
				you can go and follow them too and let us know you enjoyed it, so we can create more together.
			</p>
			<p>Then the second page which is the Feats page which has all the achievements, legendary missions and
				collectables I have done/gotton. Also on this page is a breakdown of my skills as I see them.
			</p>
			<p>The achievements, legendary missions and collectables I have tried to explain how I completed/gotton
				them. It also has a link to any videos that I have done on these or whilst trying to achieve these.
				I will say that some of these are quite hard without your buddies around to help, so if anyone wants
				a hand jump on over to the <b><a href="page/contact.html">Contact Page</a></b>
				to get the link to the fan forum, there you can ask you fellow fans or myself for our help and I
				will do my best to help you!

	<div class="l-d-container">
		<a name="chat"></a>
		<h3 class="body-hdr">Let's Chat <i class="fas fa-comments"></i></h3>
	</div>
	<div class="l-d-container">
		<div class="body-text">
			<p>Finally we have the Contact page, here I want to help my fans and gamers in general have a
				space where they can meet up and ask for certain content, help or just chat for fun.
				In time I hope to create a Discord server with lots of cool things to offer like team making
				channels for games, links to ingame clans/guilds for games that have them and many more
				channels and voice chats to help us all connect and have fun, pushing each other to our
				best selfs.
			</p>
			<p>Also on this page is a feedback form for anyone who feels that there is issues with my content,
				this can also be used to give ideas if you don't want to say it to me directly. It does ask for
				a
				name which is option, but the email is essential so I can thank you and talk about your ideas
				to see how I can help you enjoy my content,
				<b>my goal is to help you enjoy what I can offer</b>
				and I hope people won't have to use this but I can understand if you need to.
