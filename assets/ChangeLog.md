# Version Overview

## v0.60 - Toggle Button for Light/Dark Mode
Styling for the dark mode and the light mode have been added to the style.css.\
A JavaScript file called lightDarkToggle.js was created that has the function that changes the style.\
It has been tested on the game.html and will be implement on the other pages in the next commit.

## v0.52 - Intial Page Deployment
Runs correctly after user review\
All edits have been added and work as intended

## v0.51.4 - Tester 4

I have increased the bar size on all screens and text has also been increased in size\
They found that the contacts link in the Home page (index.html) doesn't work and this is now fixed

## v0.51.3 - Tester 3
I have added a top margin to both to one space them out from each other and look more inline with other elements\
I have changed the login and sign up so it will move to the center underneathe the navigation bar till the lower resolution where they will disappear and be replaced by the ones accross the top

## v0.51.2 - Tester 2
They think that the login and sign up should be a link to a seperate page not a modal\
For now as I like the way it's displayed will leave it but if this comment is consistant with users I will change the setup

## v0.51 - Tester 1
A few spelling errors where found on the conact page, these have been corrected\
Titles on the about page had a issues, on small screen their alignment has been changed\
Move where the direction to the links are to closer to the image for clarity, in computer view sits over the image\
In tablet and phone it sits as a strip above the image and text is centered

## vo.5 - Index Complete

I have responded to comments given by my mentor this can be found in the testing section of the page, test number 9\
Added a section in the Features called future features which are ones I'd like to implement in the future

Change to the colum size of the achievement section for better fit on tablet and downwards in screen size\
Added a image of the fan forum\
Added some blurb about action taken towards any violations of privacy and for any bullying or simular conduct\
Added a link with the image and the blurb above the fan forum photo with a link to the fan forum\
I choose a link to an already established hosting site for the forum to save the file size for the page for better loading, \
also the dedicated server for that is better. It will ensure no matter how big it gets it should run okay

Until it doesn't look natural and then only shows section links\
Then at tablet breakpoint it goes completely

## v0.31 - User Testing
Three scinarios wehre handed out to three users\
The results concluded a need for an index/quick navigation\
They also suggest a need for theme change for those who are used to darker page type\
Finally information about how to navigate to the youtube links need to be more visible

## v0.3 - Gaming Complete
Added some comments to the page to help direct other developers.\
Added the achievement section with an example of how I would like it set up with the achievement logo (if the game has one), with a description and name of the achievement and how it can be obtained.\
In a usable version I'd like the image to go to the games page about the achievement for example steam page for a game achievements. This would be stated in the text above it like in the example, \
i.e "The photo above will take you to the Steam achievement description for Sword Skills in Warframe."

## v0.23 - UX Update

I also made dome general UX changes to the layout of the gaming page, hopefully making it better to read and visually more appealing on different breakpoints
