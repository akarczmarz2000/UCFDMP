Change to the colum size of the achievement section for better fit on tablet and downwards in screen size
Added a image of the fan forum
Added some blurb about action taken towards any violations of privacy and for any bullying or simular conduct
Added a link with the image and the blurb above the fan forum photo with a link to the fan forum
I choose a link to an already established hosting site for the forum to save the file size for the page for better loading, 
also the dedicated server for that is better. It will ensure no matter how big it gets it should run okay

A form with a simple design has been added will be running by some testers to see there attude to the appearance

I have added an index to the left side of the page which shows links to headers and subsections 
Until it doesn't look natural and then only shows section links 
Then at tablet breakpoint it goes completely

## v0.31 - User Testing
Three scinarios wehre handed out to three users
The results concluded a need for an index/quick navigation
They also suggest a need for theme change for those who are used to darker page type
Finally information about how to navigate to the youtube links need to be more visible

## v0.3 - Gaming Complete
Added some comments to the page to help direct other developers.
Added the achievement section with an example of how I would like it set up with the achievement logo (if the game has one), with a description and name of the achievement and how it can be obtained.
In a usable version I'd like the image to go to the games page about the achievement for example steam page for a game achievements. This would be stated in the text above it like in the example, 
i.e "The photo above will take you to the Steam achievement description for Sword Skills in Warframe."

## v0.23 - UX Update

I also made dome general UX changes to the layout of the gaming page, hopefully making it better to read and visually more appealing on different breakpoints
