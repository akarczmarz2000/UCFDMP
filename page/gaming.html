	<h2>Star Wars: The Old Republic</h2>
	<p>Star Wars: The Old Republic, simply known as SWTOR or TOR, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) that was produced and released by BioWare, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts.
	The story occurs in a shaky era of the Star Wars universe, among a delicate ceasefire between the Galactic Republic, factioned by the Jedi, and the recently resurfaced Sith. <br>
	The plot will revolve around the conflicts that arise as a result of the reshuffling of power after the Great Galactic War. 
	The story will also conclude the story of Revan from the original Knights of the Old Republic.

	<h5>What do I like about it?</h5>
	<p>I like this game because its got so many class you can play and I have played quite a lot of them. My favourite is the Sith Warrior with twin blades and in the attack form.
	Basically what this means is I chose the Sith warrior class then I chose the sub-class that focuses around being fast and damaging instead of the tanky one handed build, 
	then  I chose the offesive build of the class which is done when you select there masteries. <br><br>
	I also quite like the story because of the interesting information it gives about the Star Wars extended universe. 
	Like the information about the backstory of the Emperor/Valkorian, or the information about several opperations happening 
	behind the scenes of the great war that was started as a result of the treaty of Coruscant. <b> Click on the image to see my videos! </b></p>

	<h2>Borderlands</h2>
	<p>Borderlands is a science fiction first-person shooter game with RPG elements created by Gearbox 
	Software for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Mac OS X. <br><br>
	In the distant future of the year 2864, several colonization ships head to a planet on the edge of the galaxy: Pandora. 
	The colonists are drawn there in search of a better life as well as vast mineral resources that are said to be on the planet, free for the taking.
	Some time after settling, the colonists discover that the planet offers little aside from decrepit alien ruins. When the companies mining the planet leave, 
	they let loose the criminals they had employed as forced labor and left any other colonists there. <br><br> 
	Some of the settlers seek to get rich quick by discovering alien technology, most others are just trying to survive. 
	After seven Earth years, the planet's slow orbit brings a transition from winter to spring, and many dangerous,
	horrifying creatures begin to emerge from hibernation, making Pandora even more dangerous.</p>

	<h2>Borderlands 2</h2>
	<p>A beacon of hope for the remaining colonists emerges in the form of a mysterious alien Vault carved in the side of a mountain. 
	This Vault is said to contain vast stores of alien technology and secrets. 
	The only problem is that the people who discovered the Vault were completely wiped out by some sort of protective force, 
	with the only evidence of their discovery being a scattered radio transmission, proclaiming the Vault's majesty, but not its location.
	The stories of this wealth has sparked renewed interest in Pandora, and corporations and 
	treasure hunters have begun to return to the wastelands to try and claim the treasures of the Vault. <br><br>
	Set five years after the events of Borderlands, Handsome Jack, the game's main antagonist, has taken over the Hyperion Corporation, 
	declared himself Dictator of Pandora and taken all of the credit for finding The Vault – going so far as to claim responsibility for killing The Destroyer. 
	Jack has also blotted out much of the light on the planet by having a giant orbiting 
	H-shaped base set in front of Pandora's stationary moon, creating a 'big brother' atmosphere throughout the planet.  <br><br>
	The new group of Vault Hunters in Borderlands 2 are tasked with killing Jack and returning peace to Pandora.
	Borderlands 2 begins with the protagonists on a train to an unspecified location to begin their search for the vault. 
	The train turns out to be a trap set by Handsome Jack, to kill all who search for the Vault. </p>

	<h2>Borderlands 3</h2>
	<p>Borderlands 3 is the fourth main and fifth overall entry in Gearbox Software's Borderlands game series. 
	It was announced by Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO on March 28th, 2019 and released on September 13th, 
	2019 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC on the Epic Games Store. 
	The game later released for Google Stadia on December 17th, 2019, and is set to release on Steam for PC in April 2020. Borderlands 3 is built on Unreal Engine 4. <br><br>
	Taking place approximately seven years after the events of Borderlands 2 and six years after the events of Tales from the Borderlands, 
	Borderlands 3 begins with four new Vault Hunters - Amara the Siren, FL4K the Beastmaster, Moze the Gunner, and Zane the Operative - joining Lilith's 
	Crimson Raiders as new recruits sent to investigate the Children of the Vault cult and their mysterious leaders, the Calypso twins, 
	Tyreen and Troy, who are believed to be in possession of the long lost Vault Map. <br><br>
	Upon reclaiming the Vault Map, The Crimson Raiders and allies board the 
	Sanctuary III spacecraft to journey beyond Pandora to other planets throughout the galaxy to claim the Vaults they hold before the Calypsos can steal their power for themselves.

	<h5>What I like about the games?</h5>
	<p> I like these games quite a lot and that's because of so much, it has brilliant humor, interesting characters and brilliant art. The humor maybe very dark at times but I enjoy quite a lot of the brutal jokes
	or the mannor in which some character just don't give a toss. <br><br>
	I quite like all the characters because you can find something to connect with, even the evil characters have something that makes you want to hate
	to the end of Pandora and back. This level of character development and background in the smallest to the largests parts is brilliant to watch unfold. <br><br>
	And finally possible my favouritething about these games is the art
	style, this draw/painted/realistic look makes you really feel like your in a story unfolding and the way some of the characters look is awesome. The way this all looks I think mainy, other than what I've said,
	links with me because it reminds me of a lot of the early animes I where watching which I really enjoy and takes me back to my childhood which I think adds to the sillyness of the game style.
