						<p>I love three colors, well two gradiants and one color, absolute
							favourite color is purple
							and the two gradiants (which I have had as my hair colored) is rainbow and oil spill.
							Let me know your favourite colors and if you agree with mine on the Fans Forum which
							is accessable thought the Contact page.</p>
						<p>I was born in a small town called Barnstaple, lovely place with a very small group of
							people
							so almost everyone knows each other or knows of each other.
							This did make growing up here a little strange, especially as my Nana was a teacher at a
							local
							primary school,
							which meant a lot of people I didn't know knew me</p>
						<p>Sticklepath was a lovely school, this was where my Nana worked at (she still does as
							well).
							But unfortunatly I wasn't exactly liked which
							did kinda make for a annoying childhood, everyone and the dog wanted to annoy me so I'd
							retaliate
							and unfortunatly I almost always did (I wasn't a sensible child).
							Stuff like this didn't really stop till I chilled out in my later years of Secondary
							school.
							I went to Park School for my secondary education, that was interesting.
							I started as a very angry and unhappy child and came out a Prefect who passed his exams
							moderatly
							well...</p>
						<p>At college I was more interested in doing something with my hands instead of something on
							the
							computer like I do now.
							Don't get me wrong I had my gaming PC and a Xbox and I enjoyed playing games, but for a
							career
							I really wanted to do something with my hands.
							After passing that with a distinction, which I was quite proud off, I started doing a
							Art level 3
							which was fun.
							But, after finishing the plumbing course early
							I had started working at my local McDonald's which was fun, team of lovely people, easy
							work and
							alright pay.
							Doing this and college would have been easy,
							if I wasn't trying to pay off my new awesome gaming PC. So I decided to drop college and
							work on
							what I wanted to work on,
							which was work and YouTube, and that pritty much brings up to date. Yay!</p>

				</div>
				<div class="l-d-container">
					<div class="body-text">
						<p> To understand my family I think you'd need a big chart as I have a relatively large
							family,
							but I love them all dearly.
							Something that I like to pride myself on is the where my family comes from as it's quite
							interesting
							some of the things I've been told.
							The basics of it is I'm part Devonshire, part Mediterranean, part Polish and finally
							part Irish,
							now I can tell you where most of these
							different elements come from but to be honest I'm not entirely sure where the Irish is
							from.
							What I will say though is I am quite proud
							of my Polish heratige and so I decided to learn more.</p>
						<p>In the spirit about learning more about my Polish heratige I went and learnt Polish
							(although I'm rather rust these days), and I also
							went and did a bit of digging about the family members this part of me comes from.
							This connection comes from my Great Grandfather who was
							a Polish pilot when World War 2 started, he came over to Britain, unfortunatly I am not
							sure weather
							this was before
							or after the war started.
							He was in the Polish 303 squad, which famously fought in the Battle of Britain as one of
							the last
							lines of defence,
							and he was shot down 3 times and each time he got back in and flew again and again.
							Nearing the end he did become a prisoner of war after crashing in France I believe,
							but this is one reason I am proud to call myself Polish (even if just a bit).</p>
						<p> I am also quite proud to call myself Polish because of the language,
							although it may not be as romantic as some languages or as soft as others
							its a beautiful language to me, this is why I dedicated so much time to learning it
							and I am trying to relearn it and teach others so I can use it more often.
							I'd also love the oppurtunity to use it to talk to some of the relatives that still live
							over there,
							I don't personally know them yet and that's a shame but hopefully in time I can get to
							know them.
							I also have family in Ireland and Austrail.</p>

					<h3 class="body-hdr">What Got Me Into Gaming? <i class="fas fa-headset"></i></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="l-d-container">
					<div class="body-text">
						<p>See this question here I don't know how many times I have been asked this and I've always
							answered,
							"I don't know" or "I'm not sure it was one thing". Which unfortunatly kills that
							conversation
							quick....
							So I thought I'd give it a proper thought and if I am honest I think the very first
							thing that got
							me
							into gaming was watch my Mum have fun playing Baldur's Gate. It's a game that was first
							released in
							1998
							and it was a top down role-playing game, kinda like Dungeons and Dragons (athough that
							would be
							because
							it's set in the same world)</p>
						<p> This really started it for me because I then was interested in watching my Dad when he
							was playing
							games,
							watching him felt like me watching a pro gamer these days. The level of skill he had,
							his reactions,
							his
							descions and his pure ability to somehow overcome any challenge eventurally was just
							awesome in my
							eyes,
							and to be honest he still that type of good but I like to think I am to now and that
							kinda means for
							me
							that massive novelty has worn down to "he's pritty damn good".</p>
						<p>To further answer this question and another I get asked often (why do you do YouTube?), I
							think I do
							this
							because I want to push myself till I can't be any better, and I use YouTube as a place
							to show my
							silly stuff
							so others can have a bit of joy. And trust me there is a lot of joy to be had in
							watching me piss
							about or die
							REPEATLY!</p>
						<p>Well unless your me of course but that's just how some games swing, what you've gotta be
							able to do
							is go
							right this is where I kept screwing up what can I do to avoid this happening, more
							importantly for
							most situations
							how can I counter this if I can't avoid it. I just feel like a lot of the top teir
							YouTubers are
							awesome so you don't
							see them fail often so I hope to bring a breath of fresh air, so maybe you can learn
							from my
							mistakes or just have a giggle,
							trust me at the time I might be upset but later I'll be laughing like heck.</p>

				<div class="l-d-container">
					<div class="body-text">
						<p>If I am completely honest I am not sure right now, I'd love lots of things to happen,
							weather they
							will or not is something
							different. If I had to set myself some goals for the next 5 years I'd love to have about
							5k
							subscibers,
							I really want to work on my body a bit more gaining more muscle,
							I would love to become higher teir in both Destiny 2's Crucible and League of Legends
							Ranked Matchs.
							From my personal life
							at the moment I am doing a computer coding course and I'd love to pass that with some
							good grades,
							and I'd love to move onto a job where I am doing coding and website design more so that
							I can have
							more time for
							myself again (as I currently work overnight shifts) although I wouldn't want to leave
							McDonalds as
							it feels like a small family so if I do proceed on to do more programming work I might
							keep a day or
							two at McDonalds.</p>
						<p>Obviously for future content I'd love to hear what you guys want to see and that's what
							I am here to try and show off how I would do it. Whether that's banging my head against
							a brick wall
							or kill
							enimies like a boss we will just have to see. I hope you enjoyed learning some
							interesting and
							possibly useless stuff
							about myself, if you want to know more or think there should or shouldn't be specific
							things here
							please send in a
							feedback form on the Contact page please, or if you want you can send me a private
							message. Hope you
							have a great day/night
							and remeber everything should be "Playing to the hardest! Otherwise it ain't hard
							enough".</p>
